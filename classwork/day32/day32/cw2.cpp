/*
* Method Overriding with Single Inheritance
Method overriding in cpp is a mechanism that allows a subclass to provide a specific implementation for a method
that is already defined in its superclass. The overriding method in the subclass should have the same name and
parameters (if overridden), but it may provide a different implementation.
This code demonstrates method overriding in cpp. Here's an explanation of how it works:
Base class Animal: This is the base class that defines a method make_sound(). The implementation of this method 
prints "Animal makes a sound".
Subclass Dog and Cat: These are subclasses of Animal. Each subclass defines its own version of the make_sound()
method, which overrides the implementation in the base class. The Dog subclass defines make_sound() to print
"Dog barks", and the Cat subclass defines make_sound() to print "Cat meows".
Object Creation:
  animal1 is created as an instance of the Dog class.
  animal2 is created as an instance of the Cat class.
Method Call:
   When animal1.make_sound() is called, it invokes the make_sound() method of the Dog class because animal1 is an 
   instance of Dog. This demonstrates dynamic polymorphism, where the method to be called is determined at runtime 
   based on the type of the object.
   Similarly, when animal2.make_sound() is called, it invokes the make_sound() method of the Cat class because 
   animal2 is an instance of Cat.
